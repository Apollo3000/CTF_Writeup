Testing the program from shell I noticed that buying a flimsy net and selling it was not removed from the inventory.
So we can earn infinite bells and buy the flag. 
(The official solution use tarantulas insted of flimsy net -> less cycles)

Exploit:
```python

```

# FLAG
`DawgCTF{1nf1n1t3_t@rantul@$}`
